Cognitive Systems Engineering / Human Factors Scientist,Charles River Analytics,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><b>Summary:</b><br>
Do you have a passion for technology, finding yourself backing random Kickstarter or IndieGoGo projects or attending tech meetups in your local area? Do have a desire to conceptualize and design technology applications that can disrupt current practices and truly augment and extend human cognitive, physical, sensory, or other capabilities? Have you ever wanted to be a part of the revolutionary projects that you read about coming out of organizations like DARPA? Does working on across a range of exciting R&amp;D projects with the potential to set your own research agenda excite you?
<br><br>
If so then Charles River may be the place for you!
<br><br>
Building end-to-end decision support systems that incorporate multimodal user interfaces for next generation military command and control (C2); prototyping virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) bicycle simulators to study the effects of connected vehicles and novel multimodal human-machine interfaces (HMI) on cycling safety; designing and developing endlessly scalable modeling and simulation solutions for live, virtual, and constructed (LVC) training applications; conducting empirical research on the psychophysics and ability of humans to acclimate to virtually augmented fields of vision; studying physiological and psychophysiological signals of human users to understand and predict training or task performance – these are only a handful of the exciting and forward-looking technology applications that Charles River Analytics is currently working on.
<br><br>
To contribute to our growing technical project portfolio, and help ensure our technology-driven solutions are attuned to the needs, capabilities, and limitations of their intended human users, we are seeking an individual with applied Human Factors and/or Cognitive Systems Engineering expertise to serve lead and support technology driven research and design (R&amp;D) efforts across a range of domains and on a variety of platforms and applications.
<br><br>
In this role, you will work with small teams of research scientists, software engineers, and subject matter / domain experts to design, guide development of, and evaluate interactive prototypes that leverage cutting edge technology to empower humans to efficiently and effectively augment their natural abilities.

OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY</div><div><br>
</div><div>
Collaborate on short and long term independent research projects to support scientific research objectives of the lab. Utilize programming skills to design and implement tools directly related to biological research. Analyzes experimental data, addresses methodological problems in experimental protocols and results.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND AND GOALS</div><div><br>
</div><div>
The Corradin lab is seeking an enthusiastic and motivated individual who is interested in utilizing their big data analytic skills to answer fundamental questions about the genetics of human disease. Determining genetic variants that predispose to common disease provides essential insights into the pathogenesis of human disorders. Rather than impact protein-coding genes, the majority of the genetic risk to disease alters the function of regulatory elements. Regulatory elements are noncoding regions of the genome that play a critical role in controlling gene expression programs. Gene regulation is what enables different cell types of the human body to have diverse functions, thus genetic variants that disrupt this process can have dire consequences for human health.</div><div><br>

Data Scientist - Cancer Dependency Map,Broad Institute,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>The comprehensive analysis of cancer genomes is nearly complete, but leveraging this wealth of information to improve patient outcomes remains an elusive goal. Now, a critical task in cancer research is to predict those genes and proteins that are essential to the survival of a variety of tumor subtypes. Identifying these essential genes would pave the way for developing therapeutics against specific molecular targets, and would highlight specific patient populations likely to respond to such targeted interventions. We are launching a new initiative to find vulnerabilities of cancers dependent on a well-credentialed therapeutic target for which no effective therapy exists, and to discover small molecules that may target these vulnerabilities. As part of this effort, we seek a highly motivated and talented individual with a strong computational background to join the Cancer Data Science team.

</p><p>Researchers on the Google Brain team have the freedom to set their research agenda and to engage as much or as little as they wish with existing products, choosing between doing more basic, methodological research or more applied research as necessary to produce the most compelling results. Because many of the advances we develop today may take years to become useful, the team as a whole maintains a portfolio of projects across this spectrum. It is our philosophy that making substantive progress on hard applications can help drive and sharpen the research questions we study, and in turn scientific breakthroughs can spawn entirely new applications.
</p><p>The Google Brain team’s research focuses on methods that can learn multiple layers of rich, non-linear feature extractors and can scale to large amounts of data. Much of our work is best understood as part of the deep learning subfield of machine learning, but we are interested in any methods capable of efficient and effective feature learning that get good results on challenging problems.
