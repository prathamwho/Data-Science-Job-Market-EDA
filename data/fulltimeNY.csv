<ul>
<li>organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with</li>
<li>analyze it for patterns and predictions</li>
<li>deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way</li>
<li>and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door</li>
</ul><p>The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.</p>
<p>
We place particular emphasis on providing a robust <i>system</i> of statistical insights. Our goal is not to deliver a single paper or presentation’s worth of material, but to give our customers a powerful analytical toolbox. We can help them use it, but we also want them to be able to take it and run with it, exploring their data on their own and finding uses for our models that we hadn’t even thought of.</p>
<p>
On top of that, we have an expanding customer base and a growing interest in developing analyses and statistical modeling pipelines that extend beyond e-commerce. With more customers, richer data sets, and new domains of exploration, we’ll face bigger and bigger challenges, but we think we’re up for it, and we are looking for people who want to join us for the ride.
</p><p><b>Specifically, we are looking for:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A solid foundation in statistics, either demonstrated through academic study or work experience.</li>
<li>Experience with at least two programming languages and one general-purpose statistical package or programming library. The data science team mainly uses R, Scala, and Ruby, but that’s not set in stone, and we value the ability to learn new libraries and ecosystems.
</li><li>Friendly and ready to work with others, both technical and non-technical. We don’t work in isolation and regularly interact with each other and members of other teams.
</li><li>At least some familiarity with: Unix-like operating systems, SQL databases, and web application programming. Strong experience in any is a plus.
</li><li>Other pluses: experience with distributed-computing ecosystems like Spark; experience with Amazon Web Services; experience teaching statistics or programming</li>

<p><b>What</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>here:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>On Monday we eat and meet as a team to chat projects and progress.</li>
<li>We’re 45 genuinely nice people. We work together and experiment with how to do things. It’s an amazing environment to both explore your professional interests and shape your career trajectory.</li>
<li>We move quickly. You build something and the next day it comes to life. You see and feel an immediate impact with the collective efforts of the team.</li>

But we’re only just getting started. We want to take that magic of sending money with Venmo and cascade it into every place where people use money. That means connecting people to their money in the most intuitive and fun way possible, then connecting people with each other. Users already love Venmo, but we know there are lots of things we haven’t thought of to make the experience of using Venmo even more delightful and valuable. All that’s going to take a lot of figuring out. Let’s figure it out together!

Data Analytics at Venmo
<br><br>
Analytics plays a crucial role across Venmo. We approach problems inquisitively and with a desire to find solutions in our data. We believe that Analytics should drive business decisions across the company in order to keep our product simple, joyful, and delightful.

<br><br>
As a member of the Analytics team, you’ll drive critical business decisions, build out our analytical capabilities, and work on perplexing problems. You’ll become a thought leader, and an integral part in a company that makes payments fun!

"Research Position (Various Levels), Systems Biology",Simons Foundation,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><p>The Systems Biology Group at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Biology (CCB) seeks researchers with various levels of experience. Depending on levels of experience, positions may be at-will or term-appointment.
<br>
<br>
The primary mission of the CCB is to create new computational frameworks that will enable scientists to analyze the large and complex data sets that are being generated by new experimental technologies. Tremendous opportunities for discovery are emerging in the biological and biomedical sciences, as well as in traditional physical and social sciences, but they will require the combined power of theory, data analysis, and simulation. In the biomedical sciences, for example, researchers are being confronted by an explosion of information from genome sequencing, gene expression profiling, proteomics, multi-electrode recording, and multiple high-resolution imaging modalities. The focus remains on problems arising in biophysical modeling, genomics, neuroscience, and structural biology, collaborating closely with experimental colleagues.
<br>
<br>
The Systems Biology group focuses on diverse topics, including network inference and modeling, model selection applied to biology, protein structure prediction and design, and automated protein function prediction. Systems Biology is also affiliated with the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the NYU Medical School (via Dr. Bonneau’s group at NYU, http://bonneaulab.bio.nyu.edu ). Flatiron Research Fellows (postdocs) will be given significant freedom in defining their research direction and will be provided with a unique environment that combines computer science, applied math, biology and biomedical colleagues. Research Scientists in Systems Biology may be expected to lead and coordinate several other analysts and biologists at both the foundation and collaborating university labs (i.e. will also serve as a team manager and project coordinator as the scale of data collection increases).
