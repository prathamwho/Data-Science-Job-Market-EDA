Civis Analytics helps businesses use data to gain a competitive advantage in how they identify, attract, and engage loyal customers and employees. With a powerful combination of best-in-class proprietary data, cutting-edge software solutions, and an interdisciplinary team of data scientists, developers, and survey science experts, Civis works with Fortune 500 companies and the country’s largest nonprofits to make data-driven decision-making essential to how the world’s best companies do business.
<br><br>
Civis embraces the individuality of our employees and we celebrate each other's differences. Our products, services, and culture benefit from and thrive on the unique perspectives brought by each person in our Civis community. We're proud to be an equal opportunity workplace, and we are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, age, sex, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship, marital status, disability, or Veteran status.

<br><br>
About the Role
<br><br>
Senior Software Engineers at Civis amplify the contributions of their colleagues by leading engineering teams or tackling our hardest, riskiest, or most complex technical projects. Depending on interest, roles for senior engineers may focus on team leadership or individual contribution; either way we’re looking for judgment, ownership, and autonomy. At Civis, you will be responsible for making good choices about technical questions, and also about what technical projects are worth pursuing. You will play an outsized role in making Civis a great place to build great software products.
<br><br>
What's great about being an engineer at Civis? We believe in ownership of our work and continuous learning, and we run our team to reinforce those values.
<br><br>
We trust engineers from all over our team to pick the right architecture, library, or framework for the job at hand. They help make decisions about new products in cross-functional design sprints and take quarterly hack weeks to try out new ideas and new technologies. Civis engineers push code to production on their second day and quickly ramp up on projects of increasing responsibility. We’re looking for senior engineers to make a big impact in their first few months.
<br><br>
We want to never stop learning. Everyone has a mentor from day one and tracks their personal development alongside their technical deliverables. We staff projects based on what people will learn, not just who knows it best today. Engineers collaborate across departments with our data scientists and analysts who are not only the best and brightest in their fields, but are also eager to teach and learn from you. Finally, valuing continuous learning also means recognizing that our strongest contributors stand out for their capabilities and not their credentials.
<br><br>
We are smart, fun, and a little bit weird. Does this sound like you?
<br><br>
We are looking for detail-oriented individuals from diverse backgrounds with demonstrated quantitative and problem-solving skills. We value creativity, hard work and on-the-job-excellence and offer competitive compensation and benefits packages. In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States.

<b>IDEO Chicago</b><br>
<br>
At IDEO, our world-class multidisciplinary teams create innovative solutions to address core human needs. In order to do this, we work with the latest tools and technologies to support and experiment within all aspects of our design process—from research, to design, through implementation. Software Designers at IDEO work closely with small teams that could include interaction designers, design researchers, industrial designers, communication designers, electrical and mechanical engineers.<br>
<br>
<b>Software as a creative discipline</b><br>
We believe software development is a creative discipline. Software Discipline colleagues are creative problem solvers who often employ unorthodox yet ingenious ways to push a design. They may hack a PC driving game to integrate with an automotive simulator, or they may collaborate with city organizations and data scientists to access, map and visualize raw energy usage data.<br>
<br>
<b>Why is this job important to IDEO?</b><br>
Software developers are much more than implementers, they are key members of our design teams, responsible for creating and applying technologies in service of the user experience. As a trusted advisor within the team, this senior role assesses the feasibility of design directions, and explores and develops necessary technologies for them to be realized.<br>
<br>
<b>Role summary</b><br>
Following a “build to think” approach, software designers at IDEO bring our designs to life. Colleagues in this role will create and support software with a diverse range of fidelity; from rapid prototypes, designed to facilitate conversations with users, to fully-fledged, public software products. Software Design colleagues have the opportunity to explore projects that span mobile to desktop; wearables to interactive installations.<br>
<br>
This senior position also serves as a trusted advisor to our clients, collaborating directly to ensure they are understood and empowered to champion the solutions we develop together. The credibility and integrity of this role is continually demonstrated through the evolving portfolio of his/her professional work and personal character.<br>
<br>
Lastly, this position plays a crucial role in growing and nurturing our integrated software design and development teams at IDEO Chicago through craft leadership, mentoring and external professional relationships.<br>
<br>
<b>Once you are here you will...</b><br>
Collaborate on a diverse variety of software and hardware based projects, including automotive simulators, medical devices, connected retail experiences and new startup ventures, such as:
<ul><li>Developing within the automotive CAN bus to integrate and analyze real time driving data to design new driving experiences</li>
<li>Creating tools to analyze energy customer usage data to raise customer awareness of their behaviors
</li><li>Recommending an application architecture to support a new mobile medical device and the additional tools to store, analyze and communicate the captured data to patients and their physicians</li>
<li>Extending our hardware and software prototyping tools to allow for new service design solutions for connected retail experiences</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Some previous projects to check out</b>
<ul><li>Zebra Zatar: IDEO designed the first user-centered, cloud-based platform for the enterprise – designing a simple, intuitive interface in concert with developing the supporting remote services.</li>
<li>Food Genius: We tapped into food consumption data with our first startup-in-residence to design Food Genius Reports, a consumer and food industry trends dashboard.</li>
<li>PNC Wealth Insight: After conducting deep field research with wealth managers, an IDEO team utilized real client data to create clear and concise visualizations that give investors the right level of insight.</li>
<li>State Farm NextDoor: This IDEO-designed service includes several digital touchpoints which foster person-to-person interaction, including a tablet-based coaching app that helps customers create unique financial plans to follow over time, via a secure web interface.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Relevant experience</b><br>
This position assumes diverse, hands-on professional experience. We expect colleagues in this role to be quick learners, extremely disciplined, and demonstrate interest and aptitude by their proficiency in a variety of technologies, tools and languages. Additional characteristics include:<br>
<ul><li>Passionate, self-motivated, and an inspiring champion of software as a craft.</li>
<li>Champion the craft of writing high quality software, and inspiring others in this belief.</li>
<li>Enjoy developing alongside designers.</li>
<li>Continually uncovering and sharing new developments.</li>
<li>Comfortable working with a diverse set of colleagues (co-workers, clients and mentors) to complete a project.</li>
<li>10 or more years of experience developing production applications</li>
