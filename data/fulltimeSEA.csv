UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.
<br>
<br>
UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for five consecutive years.
<br>
<br>
<b>UW eScience Institute</b> has an outstanding opportunity for an <b>Researcher, Human-centered Data Science.</b>
<br>
<br>
The <b>UW eScience Institute’s</b> mission is to engage researchers across disciplines in developing and applying advanced techniques and technologies to real-world problems in data-intensive science. In conjunction with the eScience Institute, the School of Computer Science and Engineering seeks an outstanding research scientist with expertise in the application of human-centered approaches to data science and the ethnography of data-intensive practices. This position will take a leadership role in the implementation of these approaches and practices at the eScience Institute and will also run the annual Data Science for Social Good summer program.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Researcher, Human-centered Data Science</b> is an outstanding leader and interdisciplinary scholar who will contribute to the development of human-centered data science programs and practices at the University of Washington, co-lead the Data Science Studies working group within the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at UW, and produce scholarly research on the ethnography of data science. The ideal candidate will exhibit: an ability to thrive in highly interdisciplinary research environments; experience conducting ethnographic fieldwork and using a range of qualitative methods; a passion for producing scholarly research on sociotechnical practices; and expertise in applying qualitative insights to inform data-intensive, computational work.
<br>
<br>
The successful candidate will participate in programs involving software development, technical consulting, workshops and training, and other activities designed to advance the research and practice of data-driven decision-making and data-intensive discovery. The position will also entail the execution of an ongoing research program using ethnographic and applied, practice-based, action-oriented research methods to investigate the practice and culture of data science. There will be ample opportunity to publish results, though the role will be evaluated as much by alternative metrics as by conventional metrics of publishing in traditional scholarly venues.

<br>
The Researcher, Human-centered Data Science will work collaboratively within eScience, across departments and academic units at UW, and with organizations and institutions beyond campus, including other universities, government agencies, and industry partners. This position requires excellent collaboration and communication skills, especially when engaging across disciplines and with those in more technical fields. Candidates must have a demonstrated record of independent and collaborative interdisciplinary research, and have the potential to successfully pursue external funding.
<br>
<br>
Approximately 55 percent will be dedicated to human-centered data science research activities, and approximately 45 percent of the Researcher, Human-centered Data Science’s time will be spent on action research commitments in support of eScience programs and initiatives. However, given the applied, practice-based, action-oriented nature of the research study, there is significant overlap and synergy between these two objectives.

<br>
</li><li>Provide mentorship to students and staff, including acting as an advisor and resource for sophisticated qualitative methodologies.
<br>
<br>
<i>Action Research/Programmatic Commitments</i>
<br>
</li><li>Contribute human-centered data science expertise to bridge social and technical perspectives in eScience programs and initiatives, including taking on a leadership role in implementing the Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) program.
<br>
</li><li>Develop mechanisms and opportunities for feedback and community reflection that inform organizational strategy and program development.
<br>
</li><li>Contribute to pedagogical developments that support human-centered data science practices and collaborations across different disciplinary and non-academic domains.

Data Scientist,Zume Inc.,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary"">WHO WE ARE
<br><br>
Zume is on a quest to be the most powerful source of health and well-being on the planet. We started by partnering people with technology to create a more thoughtful and efficient way to source, make, bake and deliver pizza. In the process, we are delivering an artisan pizza that takes care of the people who eat it and make it, and even takes better care of the planet we all love—a planet 9 billion people will inhabit by mid-century.
<br><br>
The health and well-being of people and our planet is dependent upon sustainably feeding that population with wholesome, affordable food on a global scale. Zume is meeting this challenge with an end-to-end, scalable platform that reduces the time and distance between clean food sources and dense population centers, using cutting-edge automation and transportation logistics. By developing better tools and processes, we can feed people healthier, sustainably-grown food, delivered fresh and free from chemical stabilization.
<br><br>
We have an employee-first philosophy and we’re deeply committed to investing in the happiness, satisfaction and success of everyone we work with. We are looking for a team who feels the same way! Join us as we change the way people think about food.

THE ROLE
<br><br>
We're expanding our fleet of vehicles that can autonomously prepare food in-transit. We've proven that we can do it with Pizza now we're going to scale it to all prepared food.
<br><br>
The problem we need to solve is a combination of Uber's ride scheduling problem with Amazon's autonomous supply chain problem, but to make things more tricky food needs to show up freshly prepared, so timing is critical. And that just the tip of the iceberg of where we're going. To scale we're going to need to solve lot of really hard problems that call for a world class data science team. That’s where you come in.
<br><br>
You should have a broad understanding of data science in general, but we're also looking for specialists in at least one of (convex) optimization, stochastic processes, time series, and machine learning. Graduate work in any of these fields is a plus. You'll need to be proficient in programming (python), and not afraid to get your hands dirty in implementation. Experience with hardware a plus, but not required.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.
</div></div><div>People issue over 2 billion searches on Facebook every day to find people, pages, videos, and connect with the communities and interests that matter to them. Facebook Search team is working to build a global, general-purpose search engine that leverages the unique content and social connections on Facebook. By unlocking the unique information and connections available on Facebook, we believe we can provide a more meaningful experience for people around the world, especially in mobile-first countries. To achieve our goal, we need to solve some of the most challenging engineering problems in the industry, across areas such as Infrastructure, Product, Mobile, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
<br>
Being a complex engineering system, Facebook Search depends on several machine learning models and heavy natural language processing. Understanding the user's search intent from their search query is crucial to retrieving and matching the right content from Facebook's vast amount of social data. NLP team focuses on developing various machine learning technologies to process and transform a search query into a form that is utilized by the subsequent systems for retrieval and ranking. Context of the search query and its implicit and explicit semantics play an important role in satisfying the searcher's information need. Similar technologies are utilized to decipher the meaning and intent of the content in Facebook to create the matching between user intent and content.
<br>
A Data Scientist in this role will leverage his knowledge and understanding of these technologies along with the vast and powerful search dataset in order to: (1) provide tactical engineering systems development guidance by bridging lower level NLP system components' performance to higher level product performance (2) perform various forms of opportunity analyses to influence NLP systems development roadmap and (3) collaborate with software engineers to help develop better ways of understanding search queries and content on Facebook. This is a key role within the greater search team and it requires heavy involvement with technical aspects of the core search technology.

Operations Research Scientist,Amazon.com,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Job Description
</b></h2><div><div><div>Take hundreds of millions of shipments, a gigantic fulfillment network, reliable premium delivery service and optimizing decisions on transportation cost (involving billions of dollars in transportation spend). Combine this with the opportunity to be a key research leader and individual contributor building innovative transportation capabilities for the world’s most customer-centric company and what do you get? The best optimization R&amp;D role- period.<br>
<br>
The context: Amazon ships millions of unique shipments through its Fulfillment Network. Product is procured from tens of thousands of vendors, third party sellers into the multiple fulfillment centers in the Amazon network. Merchandise from these vendors needs to be transported from vendor locations to these fulfillment centers and between fulfillment centers as we balance our inventory across our network. Amazon has the largest selection – merchandise is associated with varying dimensions, restrictions and shipping costs – this selection is key to Amazon’s virtuous cycle for growth. Post purchase by customers, we are responsible for transportation of shipments from fulfillment centers to customers; this involves moving shipments from our fulfillment centers to sortation centers and delivery depots. This results in a gigantic graph, with the nodes being vendors, Amazon.com fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery depots and end customers. The arcs in this graph represent the time of transportation and cost of transportation. Each node has a specific capacity, and so does each arc, and there are time constraints on when a product needs to ship out of a node and when it needs to come into a different node. And Amazon needs to do all of this while incurring the least cost, this presents a great opportunity to leverage large scale network optimization models to drive decision making processes.<br>
<br>
Modeling and Optimization team is responsible for building network optimization models and analytic tools that improve the economics of the North American, European, and Asian fulfillment networks as Amazon increases the speed and decreases the cost to deliver product to customers. We are looking for motivated individuals with strong numerical optimization and analysis skills to join our team focusing on transportation network modeling and design. You will be responsible for building tools to determine the means to efficiently transport shipments from vendors to our fulfillment centers, as well as from fulfillment centers to our customers. In particular, you will focus on building models that will be leveraged to drive the optimization of the transportation infrastructure, transportation contract negotiation, increase speed of delivery and evaluate opportunities to decrease cost through new initiatives. Some of the key job responsibilities<br>
Own the strategic planning and research initiatives involved with the transportation network including network optimization, process improvement and sizing up opportunities from new initiatives. Build prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to the decision systems and operational processes.<br>
<br>
Partner closely with business and IT groups. Provide analysis using mathematical modeling tools to benchmark existing operations/processes as well as to identify opportunities for improvement. Work closely with IT teams in enhancing the prototypes and implementing them in our production environment.<br>
Effectively communicate with senior management as well as with colleagues from computer science, operations research and business backgrounds.<br>
<br>
A proven history of driving critical research and development, algorithms and optimization is needed to be successful in this role.<br>

<b>HCDE</b> has an outstanding opportunity for a <b>Research Scientist.</b>
<br>
<br>
Working with Dr. David Ribes, the Research Scientist will contribute to research activities outlined in NSF award “Knowledge Infrastructures for Sustainable Transitions”. The project proceeds in two broad phases of iterative field research and document collection - the research scientist (RS) will be a collaborator working under the supervision of Dr. Ribes, the PI. The first phase will focus on exploring available archival documentary evidence (proposals, reports, etc). Using archival data the PI and RS will trace the formation and initial development of each organization. At the same time the PI and research scientist will conduct exploratory ethnography at selected local sites. Through field research and interviews this research will examine the current state of each organization, and how members reflexively work to prepare for the future. Document collection and preliminary interviews will be designed to build and test preliminary couplings between the entire organization and local site activity.
<br>
<br>
In a second iteration of research will return to field sites and archival data to target specific concepts for theoretical elaboration. The grounded theory methodology is iterative, demanding several returns to the field and data in order to ‘theoretically sample,’ or investigate features that require more data to understand them. In the second phase of the project, the PI and RS will conduct a second iteration of field research within each project. The second phase of the project will continue (but scale down) ethnographic and targeted archival research in the follow-on sites, while focusing on project outreach, education, and publication.

Founded in 2011 on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the unconditional love of a dog, Rover improves and simplifies life for pet parents and the dogs they love.</div><div><br>
</div><div>
We're headquartered in downtown Seattle. We're an agile, fast-growing startup, and our leadership comes from some of the country's most respected tech companies. Our Senior Leadership team has been recognized by Forbes, Seattle Business, and Geekwire. We've been named among Seattle's ""Best Places to Work"" in Seattle Met magazine, Seattle Business Magazine, and the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2016 and 2017. We're also the recipient of World’s Most Dog-Friendly Offices in 2016 by Inc.com.

The Senior Data Scientist at Rover will possess broad enough experience to contribute to each of the three classes of problem outlined above, while also being deep enough to lead at least one of them end-to-end. In every case, and regardless of the specific techniques employed, the Senior Data Scientist will be responsible for managing long-running experiments with significant impact on how users interact with Rover.com, participate in our marketplace, and find care for their dogs. This is a non-trivial responsibility: on the one hand, there is tremendous value to be driven in continuing to optimize the Rover marketplace, while on the other hand the opportunity cost associated with long-running experiments (in time and dollars) is very high.</div><div><br>
</div><div>
For this reason, real-world experience in this class of problem is a requirement, and experience working in an online marketplace specifically is strongly preferred.</div><div><br>
</div><div><b>
What does Data Science mean at Rover?</b></div><div><br>
</div><div>
There are three broad classes of core Data Science problems with which we are engaged at Rover:</div><div><br>

</div><div>
2. Machine learning: the ongoing development of the machine learning infrastructure that enables continuous learning from our data, where success is also measured in terms of marketplace efficiency gains as well as the rate at which different aspects of the user experience are incorporated into our ML systems</div><div><br>
</div><div>
3. Scaling user testing: the parallelization and democratization of end-user testing across all aspects of the product and user experience, where success is measured in terms of testing velocity across the organization</div></div>

</b></h2><div><div><div>Recommending products to Amazon customers – yes, that is the space that we work in. We blend a variety of disciplines (such as recommender systems, data mining, NLP, big data and ML) to turn an intractable problem into a hard problem. For example: just because someone bought a purple dress does not mean that purple is the right color for them for all seasons; neither does it mean that you should recommend purple accessories. Just when someone buys a sofa, which rug in Amazon’s vast selection would it make most sense to pair with it? While there are other recommendation problems out there, none of them capture the scale of the problem, the rapidly changing inventory along with unique problems of fit, fabric and finish.<br>
<br>
So how do we do it? We are a full stack team that own components all the way from dataset generation, high performance service oriented architecture to building great UIs that can surface recommendations in a pleasing and aesthetically appealing way.

You will own and build infrastructure that accesses terabyte of data to produce and deliver datasets with low latency and high reliability. The goal is to innovate new discovery features that can make a huge impact on the customer experience. What recommendations data could you use to make search more personalized? How can we use product similarity and sales data to augment and enrich our recommendations? How can we influence customers to drive long term value to Amazon?<br>
We are looking for people who innovate, love solving hard problems, understand both technology and business, and have a great judgement skills. You will be able to build systems that will impact millions of customers and create multi-million dollar revenue opportunities, ship in just a couple of weeks and instantly measure the impact of what you have developed. And be able to go home and show your friends and family how you change the world!<br>

Due to the increase in volume of research IT collaborative projects being generated by the organization (e.g. Clinical Data 2 Health Center, Kidney Precision Medicine, etc.), UW Medicine has determined that a new program needs to be implemented. The Research IT Program ('RIT Program') will focus on managing the Research IT components of these large collabortive research projects. Implementing a centralized program will allow for better prioritization and coordination of necessary Research IT resources across multiple projects and entities because many of these resources are shared by all research projects. This increased coordination will help to eliminate project resource collisions between concurrent projects, to better coordinate timing of projects, and to raise awareness of all of the research project work occurring.
<br>
<br>
We are seeking a Research IT Program Manager ('Program Manager') to provide leadership, development and management to the RIT Program.

In addition, this position will be in contact with sensitive patient information and must ensure that appropriate business processes and procedures are followed in accordance with local, Washington state, and US Federal compliance regulations.

<br>
The Program Manager must work with closely with multiple UW Medicine and partner organization (e.g. Fred Hutchinson, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, etc.) teams, design/build teams, user commmittees, and workgroups.

</b></h2><div><div><div>Amazon's Advertising Platform is positioned to grow its share of the online advertising industry due to its unique combination of online retail behavior data, industry-leading cloud services, and a fast-moving startup culture. The targeting platform enables our ad systems to deliver the right ads to the right users. To accomplish this goal, we are applying the latest low latency, big data technologies and toolsets which allow us to understand our users interests and personalize their experiences.<br>
<br>
About you:<br>
You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack - from customer facing features, to algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.<br>
<br>
Some problem spaces we'll be working on:<br>
<br>
TARGETING - we have a wealth of data already about the customers we interact with; what they've been shopping for, what they've recently purchased, etc. This data can be used to help us decide what else they are likely to be interested in and to respond to. Accessing this data and making decisions across large numbers of potential responses in a matter of milliseconds is a tough problem, and requires complex high scale engineering both online and offline. . You will be working with other driven engineers to deliver our features and solutions. This will require core engineering and programming skills, insight, technical capability, data driven decision making, creativity and an obsession to ship high quality solutions for our customers.<br>
<br>
MACHINE LEARNING &amp; ANALYTICS - there's an almost overwhelming amount of data available, and we need to build the best models to predict which signals are likely to have an impact and which aren't. We're building platforms to automate the generation, validation, and publishing of models that incorporate all available data to predict any measurable signal. You will be working in the designing, building and finally shipping these products together with partners, product management, other engineers and data scientists.<br>
<br>
CUSTOMER FACING TOOLS - all our processes are driven through a toolset that we have built. You will establish the roadmap for our customer facing functionalities, ensure prioritization and ultimately build these features. Shipping a high quality toolset always requires being data driven and having strong engineering skills. You need to be obsessed with ensuring the best end to end experience for our customers.<br>
<br>
As a TPM, you will anticipate bottlenecks, provide escalation management, anticipate and make trade-offs, and balance the business needs versus technical constraints. An ability to take large, complex projects and break them down into manageable pieces, develop functional specifications, then deliver them in a successful and timely manner is expected. Maturity, high judgment, negotiation skills, ability to influence, analytical talent, and leadership are essential to success in this role.<br>

"Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, Computational Biology",Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"<span id=""job_summary"" class=""summary""><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Overview
</b></h2><div><div><div><div>Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here</div><br>
<ul><li>
We have an open postdoc position in the lab of Dr. Frederick (Erick) A. Matsen of at least two years duration with solid pay and great benefits</li><li>
The project is to learn about anti-HIV antibody development and coevolution using data coming from a unique HIV superinfection cohort for which the viral history has been carefully characterized</li><li>
There will be many opportunities to develop and deploy new methods in a team pushing the boundaries of Bayesian phylogenetic analysis</li><li>
We will work with collaborators to validate inferences using lab techniques</li><li>
The larger research group is highly collaborative, with deep expertise in virology, protein evolution, and structural/functional analysis</li><li>
We’re a Python shop looking for someone who isn’t afraid of large-scale data analysis and has high standards for organization and code clarity</li></ul><div>
This is a unique time, full of opportunity, to be working on B cell receptor (antibody) sequences. The field is awash with data, and methods haven’t really caught up: there is still lots to do to develop methods that fully make use of the data but also scale to large data sets.</div><br>
<div>
The Fred Hutch is also a unique place to be doing this work, with a convergence of many very strong research programs. This project is a collaborative endeavor between</div><ul><li>
Julie Overbaugh’s lab brings decades of experience analyzing HIV infection and the corresponding immune response.</li><li>
Jesse Bloom’s lab does groundbreaking work understanding protein evolution at the pathogen-immune interface; they recently did deep mutational scanning on HIV env, influenza in the presence of antibody selection and are gearing up to do more in HIV, including DMS on anti-HIV antibodies.</li><li>
Kelly Lee’s lab brings a full stack of cutting-edge technology to study virus/immune reactions from a structural perspective.</li><li>
My group works to develop advanced Bayesian phylogenetic techniques and tools to understand antibody sequences.</li></ul><div>
(In passing, I also note that the HIV Vaccine Trials Network has its primary leadership here, and they are very interested in using B cell sequencing to understand vaccine response.)</div>
</div></div></div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Responsibilities
</b></h2><div><div><div><div>This project is to analyze the antibody immune response in Dr. Overbaugh’s priceless samples from a cohort of Kenyan sex workers in the era before widely-available antiretrovirals. The general goal is to understand the broad and potent antibody responses raised by these women. Our part of that goal will be to perform sequence analysis to understand the events leading to, selective pressures on, and co-evolution of HIV-responsive lineages. This will include close inspection of individual data sets as well as methods development to characterize the antibody response in more detail.</div><br>
<div>
This project will entail be a convergence of the two primary themes in my group: Bayesian phylogenetics and B cell receptor sequence analysis. Our recent work has convinced us that Bayesian methods are needed for antibody ancestral sequence reconstruction, and we’re going all-in. There special challenges, such as context sensitive mutation and strong natural selection, and also special opportunities.</div><br>
<div>
One of the special opportunities that this work provides is that these inferences can be validated by lab work.</div><div><br>
The Overbaugh lab is expert at expressing antibodies and testing their properties, in particular against viruses isolated from these same individuals. This will create a beautiful dynamic feedback loop that we can use to learn about coevolution.</div><div>
In case you aren’t already stoked, here’s an image from Liao et al 2013 showing the epic evolutionary battle between HIV (top) and antibodies (bottom):</div><br>
