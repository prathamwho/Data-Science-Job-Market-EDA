The candidate will contribute to various research, data analysis, capacity building, and communication activities led by SDA. SDA’s activities interconnect disciplines at the nexus of economics, environment, farming systems, geography and policy analysis to improve the welfare of the poor through a productive, sustainable and profitable agriculture. By taking advantage of a common data standard - from georeferenced household surveys to remotely-sensed satellite imagery and scenario modeling analyses- in regions with traditionally limited data availability, SDA bridges the divide between quantitative analysis and policy.</p>
<p>It is envisaged that the RA will work on various projects SDA is involved in, including Africa Research In Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (RISING), International Dietary Data Expansion (INDDEX), and Gender-sensitive, Climate-resilient Agriculture for Nutrition (GCAN ). Through action research and development partnerships, Africa RISING aims to create opportunities for smallholder farm households in six Sub-Saharan Africa countries to reduce poverty, hunger, and undernutrition through sustainable intensification of their farming systems. The INDDEX project is designed to fill the information gap on the ability to quantify a population’s food and nutrient consumption and dietary patterns, critical factors for effective food security and nutrition policymaking and programming. GCAN aims to assist practitioners and experts in collecting and analyzing climate science and other data to improve understanding of the linkages between climate, nutrition, and gender, as well as to identify innovations and approaches for sustainably improving productivity, nutrition, climate resilience and gender equality.</p>
<p>This is a one-year appointment based at IFPRI Headquarters in Washington, DC.</p>
<p><b>Essential Duties:</b></p>
<p>The successful candidate will conduct a range of activities including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul><li><p>Analyze various large-scale microdata collected by SDA team and other secondary sources</p>
</li><li><p>Assist with the preparation of project reports, research articles, proposals, and other outreach materials</p>
</li><li><p>Manage, aggregate, and analyze data (to be) collected through project-specific databases</p>
</li><li><p>Actively interact with various SDA partners, including by traveling to program countries and providing in-country trainings as necessary</p>
</li><li><p>Assist with the planning and implementation of various primary data collection efforts</p>
<p><b>Required Qualifications</b><b>:</b></p>

<li>Experience with Bayesian modeling, Markov chain (MC) &amp; Hidden Markov Model (HMM), predictive analytics, uncertainty models, decision risk, agent-based modeling, etc.)</li>
<li>Demonstrated work, research or educational experience in a field relevant to intelligence analysis; for example, international affairs, economic analysis, military science and capabilities, human factors, industrial analysis, spatial analytics, big data analysis, operational planning, wargaming/exercise planning and facilitation, etc.</li>
<li>Extensive and relevant experience with research methods and data analysis; including a demonstrated understanding of evidence-based behavioral/social science analytic methods, including the understanding of structured analytic techniques, probability theory, decision analysis, statistical and data analysis, signal detection theory, game theory, operations research, qualitative analysis, etc.</li>

<b>Title:</b> Strategy and Research Data Scientist
<br><br>
<b>Location(s):</b> Position Available in Washington DC
<br><br>
<b>Security Clearance:</b> Secret
<br><br>
<b>Requirements:</b> Immediate Opening
<br><br>
Background
<br><br>
This position is based in the United States Agency for International Development s (USAID) Center for Digital Development (CDD), on the Strategy &amp; Research (S&amp;R) Team. CDD is part of the U.S. Global Development Lab, which aims to harness the power of science, technology, innovation, and partnerships to source and scale dramatic breakthroughs that accelerate the achievement of foreign policy and development goals. CDD builds the Agency s technical capacity in the responsible use of digital technologies and data-driven approaches, and supports the public goods, partnerships, and policy change that improve the enabling environment for the responsible use of these building block technologies.
<br><br>
CDD houses a forward-looking think tank -styled team, the Strategy &amp; Research Team (S&amp;R), which conducts research and analysis around the impacts in low- and middle-income country contexts of emerging-technology trends, like machine learning, distributed ledger technologies, Internet of Things, etc. This requires conducting both technically rooted research (e.g. How does this new tech actually work? or What are some of the practical limitations of greater reliance on this technology in USAID s work? ) as well as more sociotechnically rooted research (e.g. What are some of the social, economic, or political impacts of the use of this emerging tech in developing country contexts? ). We seek a Data Scientist to first strengthen S&amp;R s ability to explore emerging technologies and data science tools using technically rigorous and policy-relevant analysis, and second, to apply the most promising emerging technologies to the work USAID does.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Test emerging technologies abilities to acquire, process, manage, and analyze data from a range of sources for improved decision making.
<br><br>
Assist USAID subject matter experts with data science focused analytical thinking for improved planning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of programs.
<br><br>
Apply novel data science techniques to priority international development challenges
<br><br>
Collaborate with a cohort of interdisciplinary experts within the Center for Digital Development, including the GeoCenter, Development Informatics, Digital Inclusion, and Digital Financial Services teams.
<br><br>
Strategic Planning, Support, and Capacity Building
<br><br>
Provide consultation to non-technical audiences and develop and implement guidance on integration of emerging technologies and analytical approaches in routine decision making processes.
<br><br>
Prepare high-quality concept papers, background analyses, and policy-relevant guidance to build support for the responsible use of emerging technologies and data science techniques throughout USAID.
<br><br>
Facilitate discussion among key USAID stakeholders to articulate a vision and plan for responsibly integrating emerging technologies and novel data science approaches into planning, delivering, and assessing development programs
<br><br>
Provide training and capacity building services to non-technical audiences on accessing, evaluating, and understanding emerging technologies and analytical approaches in the context of international development programming.
<br><br>
Skills and Capabilities
<br><br>
The Data Scientist will demonstrate experience and expertise in the following technical areas:
<br><br>
An advanced quantitative degree such as Statistics, Bioinformatics, Physics, Math, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or related technical field
<br><br>
